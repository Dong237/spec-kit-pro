**Created**: [DATE]
**Source**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

## Overview

This document analyzes user tasks from a UX perspective, identifying goals, steps, decision points, and potential pain points for each key user journey.

## Task 1: [Primary Task Name]

**Actor**: [User persona or role]
**Goal**: [What the user wants to achieve]
**Frequency**: [Daily | Weekly | Occasionally | Once]
**Criticality**: [High | Medium | Low]

### Prerequisites

Before starting this task, the user must:
- [ ] [Prerequisite 1 - e.g., "Have an account"]
- [ ] [Prerequisite 2 - e.g., "Be logged in"]
- [ ] [Prerequisite 3 - e.g., "Have at least one item"]

### Steps

| # | Action | Screen | Expected Result | Time Est. |
|---|--------|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| 1 | [User action] | [Screen name] | [System response] | [Xs] |
| 2 | [User action] | [Screen name] | [System response] | [Xs] |
| 3 | [User action] | [Screen name] | [System response] | [Xs] |
| 4 | [User action] | [Screen name] | [System response] | [Xs] |
| 5 | [User action] | [Screen name] | [System response] | [Xs] |

**Total Estimated Time**: [X seconds/minutes]

### Decision Points

| Step | Decision | Options | Factors |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| [#] | [What choice user faces] | A: [option] / B: [option] | [What influences choice] |
| [#] | [What choice user faces] | A: [option] / B: [option] | [What influences choice] |

### Pain Points

| Severity | Issue | Impact | Mitigation |
|----------|-------|--------|------------|
| 🔴 High | [Issue description] | [User impact] | [How to address] |
| 🟡 Medium | [Issue description] | [User impact] | [How to address] |
| 🟢 Low | [Issue description] | [User impact] | [How to address] |

### Success Criteria

- [ ] [Measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Feedback confirmation - e.g., "Success message shown"]

### Error Scenarios

| Error | Cause | User Sees | Recovery |
|-------|-------|-----------|----------|
| [Error type] | [What triggers it] | [Error message] | [How to recover] |
| [Error type] | [What triggers it] | [Error message] | [How to recover] |

### Steps

| # | Action | Screen | Expected Result | Time Est. |
|---|--------|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| 1 | [Action] | [Screen] | [Result] | [Time] |
| 2 | [Action] | [Screen] | [Result] | [Time] |
| 3 | [Action] | [Screen] | [Result] | [Time] |

### Decision Points

| Step | Decision | Options | Factors |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| [#] | [Choice] | [Options] | [Factors] |

### Pain Points

| Severity | Issue | Impact | Mitigation |
|----------|-------|--------|------------|
| 🟡 Medium | [Issue] | [Impact] | [Fix] |

### Success Criteria

- [ ] [Outcome]

## Task Comparison Matrix

| Task | Steps | Est. Time | Frequency | Priority |
|------|-------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| [Task 1] | [#] | [time] | [freq] | P1 |
| [Task 2] | [#] | [time] | [freq] | P2 |
| [Task 3] | [#] | [time] | [freq] | P3 |

## Common Pain Points Across Tasks

| Pain Point | Affected Tasks | Root Cause | Recommended Solution |
|------------|----------------|------------|---------------------|
| [Issue 1] | Task 1, Task 3 | [Why it happens] | [How to fix] |
| [Issue 2] | All tasks | [Why it happens] | [How to fix] |
| [Issue 3] | Task 2 | [Why it happens] | [How to fix] |

## Optimization Opportunities

### Quick Wins (Low effort, High impact)
1. [Improvement 1]
2. [Improvement 2]

### Future Enhancements (Higher effort)
1. [Enhancement 1]
2. [Enhancement 2]

## Persona Perspectives

### [Persona 1: New User]
- **Familiarity**: Low
- **Key Tasks**: [Which tasks they perform]
- **Special Needs**: [Extra guidance, simpler flows]
- **Pain Point Focus**: [What frustrates them most]

### [Persona 2: Power User]
- **Familiarity**: High
- **Key Tasks**: [Which tasks they perform frequently]
- **Special Needs**: [Keyboard shortcuts, bulk actions]

## Accessibility Considerations

| Task | Accessibility Need | Implementation |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| All | Keyboard navigation | Tab order, focus indicators |
| Forms | Screen reader | ARIA labels, error announcements |
| Lists | Screen reader | List semantics, item counts |

---

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Task | Target | Current |
|--------|------|--------|---------|
| Task completion rate | [Task] | > 95% | TBD |
| Time to complete | [Task] | < 30s | TBD |
| Error rate | [Task] | < 5% | TBD |
| Drop-off rate | [Task] | < 10% | TBD |

## Notes

- Task analysis should be validated with real user testing
- Pain points should be prioritized by frequency × severity
- Success criteria should be measurable and testable
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios for each task
